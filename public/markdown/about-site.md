This portfolio is a creative exploration of what a personal website can be. It's designed to look and feel like Apple's macOS, offering a unique and interactive way to showcase about my work and skills.



This project was built with a modern and efficient tech stack:

*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)**: A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution.
*   **[UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that keeps the styling clean and maintainable.
*   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
